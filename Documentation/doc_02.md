Description: This program uses a stack to:

Convert infix expression to postfix.
Evaluating the postfix expression with the help of operating precedence.
Important functions used in this program:

push()	            Inserts an element into the stack
pop()	            Removes the top element from the stack
peek()	            Returns the top element
precedence()	    Determines operator priority
infixToPostfix()	Converts infix to postfix
